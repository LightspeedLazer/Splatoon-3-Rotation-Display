## About
Uses [splatoon3.ink](https://splatoon3.ink/) to display the future Splatoon 3 schedules along with upcoming and recent Splatfest data right on your desktop using Rainmeter

## Installation/Updating Instructions
1. Install [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) if not already installed
2. Download the .rmskin file from the [latest version](https://github.com/LightspeedLazer/Splatoon-3-Rotation-Display/releases/latest)
3. Run the .rmskin file

## Controls
* Click and drag to move the display to anywhere on your desktop
* Clicking the arrow buttons or scrolling will change the displayed schedule to the next or previous mode
* Right click to bring up the Rainmeter context menu. There are two menu options under "Custom skin actions"
  * Refresh File: Refreshes the Rainmeter skin (Note: Refreshing the skin through the default Rainmeter "Refresh Skin" doesn't really do anything)
  * Repull Data: Pulls schedule data from [splatoon3.ink](https://splatoon3.ink/) and refreshes the file
* Hover over anything in the schedule area to see more info
  * Day/Time: Shows the time in MM/DD HHam/pm format
  * Mode: Shows the name of the mode
  * Stage: Shows the name of the stage
  * Weapon: Shows the name of the weapon
  * King Salmonid: Shows the name of the King Salmonid

## Features
* Shows all the schedule data you'd normally get from the Nintendo Online app and more
* Shows the upcoming splatfest soon after it is announced
* Shows the tricolor data 24 hours before the splatfest starts
* Shows the splatfest results as soon as they are posted, team in the top left is the winner
* Big Runs and Eggstra Work shifts are indicated with a golden background
* Time boxes have a red bar that indicates progress through the rotation

## Extra Notes
* Every time the schedule updates, it will take a little bit for Rainmeter to refresh
* Schedule icons, game mode icons, and King Salmonid icons are not downloaded automatically. If any of these are added to Splatoon 3 at some point in the future, come back here and check the patch notes for the version where I add the new icons
* Sometimes the display will appear above all of your other windows when the schedule updates. I have no clue what causes this, but it seems to stop after a couple of schedule changes
